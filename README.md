# End to end machine learning project

This project seeks to predict the math score of students based on a number of factors, including: preparation course completion, racial/ethnic demographic, provided lunch, and more.

Analysis of the dataset can be found in the "notebook" sub-directory.

This project is deployed following Continuous Integration, Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) over Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Microsoft Azure.

# Note Concerning project

I followed a tutorial for the completion and deployment of this project. This allows me to best understand industry practices for project creation and deployment prior to implementing this process using my own personal projects. This project will be deployed using AWS, Azure, Flask, and Python.
